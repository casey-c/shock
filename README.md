## Shock
Shock is an interactive tool for generating randomized audio samples using machine learning techniques. Shock takes various samples of the same subject matter as input to use as training data for the various underlying algorithms. These algorithms may be tweaked through various settings to produce the level of randomness or similarity required. Shock will then produce a randomized output sound that mimics the input samples; this process may be repeated indefinitely, with options to save output files as they are generated, or played back through one continuous stream.

#### Features
Shock is currently under heavy development, but we expect a major release at the end of Q4. In the meantime, we will be developing with 1 week sprints, so each week should have some new features that we will add to this list.
